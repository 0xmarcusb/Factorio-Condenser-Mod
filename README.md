My idea is to create a small building that consumes the pollution in Factorio and outputs a small amount of Sulfur. My in-game logic is that by cooling the polluted air, the sulfur can be extracted from the condensation.

The building is 1 tile square, in size, and consume similar energy to a Radar. 

The recipe is: 

-12 steel

-10 electric engines

-16 advanced circuits

-10 pipes

-10 copper cables

-100 lubricant.

The intended use is to reduce pollution and not to make it a viable Sulfuric Acid source.

The high resource cost and niche use make it a later-game item, for games/situations where pollution may be a serious factor.
It's unique shape and input/output requirements should encourage some thought on positioning, though using them isn't intended to be a puzzle to solve.

Through developing this mod, I have learned some Lua and made a functional product.
